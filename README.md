# Description

In the final project for Renato Rocha Souza's Digital Humanities course, I want to show everything I learned during the semester, how I approach working with data and presenting it with different tools and techniques.

The project is about changes, improvements, and best browser support for HTML tags and CSS properties that will subsequently lead to better support for the Accessibility API by visualizing data with Python via Jupiter Notebook.

As above mentioned, this project is not to show a perfect Jupiter Notebook (that would not be possible with the knowledge I have at the moment about Python, Pandas, as such) but especially to show what I have learned during class throughout the semester, what progress I made using Python, Jupiter Notebook and Python's different libraries by combining my new won knowledge and my topic of interest in one project.

![I am a work in progress!](https://github.com/YuriDevAT/browser_compatibility_a11y/blob/master/assets/work_in_progress.gif)

## Research question
- How many HTML tags and CSS properties are supported?
- Does every browser support the same (ammount) of HTML tags and CSS props?
- Which browser supports the most tags and props?
- How did browser support for HTML tags and CSS properties change over the years?
- How did browsers develop over the years?

## Tools & Techniques
- Jupiter Notebook
- Python
- Web Scraping
- [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
