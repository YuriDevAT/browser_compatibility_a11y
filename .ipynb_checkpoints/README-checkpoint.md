# Description

In the final project for Renato Rocha Souza's Digital Humanities course, I want to show changes, improvements, and best browser support for HTML tags and CSS properties that will subsequently lead to better support for the Accessibility API by visualizing data with Python via Jupiter Notebook.

This project is not only to show the above but especially to show what I have learned during class throughout the semester, what progress I made using Python, Jupiter Note book and Python's different libraries by combining my new won knowledge and my topic of interest in one project.

## Research question
- How many HTML tags and CSS properties are supported?
- Does every browser support the same (ammount) of HTML tags and CSS props?
- Which browser supports the most tags and props?
- How did browser support for HTML tags and CSS properties change over the years?
- How did browsers develop over the years?

## Tools & Techniques
- Jupiter Notebook
- Python
- Web Scraping
